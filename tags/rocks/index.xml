      <description>With the big rainfalls we have had this year we knew that there would be wildflowers. While spending a few days in Paso Robles we thought we would explore a little and ended up heading over to Lake Nacimiento. It was definitely worth the trip as the wild flowers were out in force.
While the wild flowers were the highlight of the trip on our way back to the freeway I spotted this great folded sandstone which was completely unexpected.</description>

      <title>Huge Crystals in Granite at Monastery Beach</title>

      <description>Cora and I love climbing around the rocks at Monastery Beach in Carmel. We get to see granite in a lot of places in California but it is rare than you can see it layered like this, especially in such as accessible place. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever heading to Big Sur it is worth stopping here to walk around.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d read about folded radiolarian chert getting pushed up onto land and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen pictures but I have to say the pictures do not do it justice. Driving down Conzelman Road in Sausalito you can get up close and it is quite a sight.
While you&amp;rsquo;re in the area, it is worth going to Black Sands Beach to see the black sand, it is quite striking, and the pillow basalt.</description>

      <title>Red Rock Canyon State Park</title>

      <description>There are parks that are easy to get to and that are in places where you&amp;rsquo;re likely to go so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to drop in on a trip. This is not one of them. It&amp;rsquo;s East of Bakersfield and North of Lancaster and is really a destination in itself. If you make the trip though you are rewarded by some geology you don&amp;rsquo;t often get to see.
Cora really enjoyed running around all the rocks.</description>
