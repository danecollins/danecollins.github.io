      <description>With the big rainfalls we have had this year we knew that there would be wildflowers. While spending a few days in Paso Robles we thought we would explore a little and ended up heading over to Lake Nacimiento. It was definitely worth the trip as the wild flowers were out in force.
While the wild flowers were the highlight of the trip on our way back to the freeway I spotted this great folded sandstone which was completely unexpected.</description>

      <title>Huge Crystals in Granite at Monastery Beach</title>

      <description>Cora and I love climbing around the rocks at Monastery Beach in Carmel. We get to see granite in a lot of places in California but it is rare than you can see it layered like this, especially in such as accessible place. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever heading to Big Sur it is worth stopping here to walk around.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d read about folded radiolarian chert getting pushed up onto land and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen pictures but I have to say the pictures do not do it justice. Driving down Conzelman Road in Sausalito you can get up close and it is quite a sight.
While you&amp;rsquo;re in the area, it is worth going to Black Sands Beach to see the black sand, it is quite striking, and the pillow basalt.</description>

      <description>The waterfall through the basalt cliff is spectacular. We got to see it late in the afternoon and the sun was not at the best angle but this is a place that is worth going to more than once.</description>

      <description>There is a path that goes from Rincon Point (with a little effort you can actually start from Carpinteria State Park) all the way to Marina Park in Ventura. Much of the trail is right along the ocean and the view is wonderful. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy ride that is well worth it.</description>

      <description>Initially uncertain about what to expect, our visit to the Petrified Forest National Park was a delightful revelation. This expansive park offers more than just a casual glimpse into ancient geology; it provides a captivating landscape filled with petrified wood.
Why the Petrified Forest is Worth the Visit
Ample Space to Roam: One of the first things you&amp;rsquo;ll notice is the park&amp;rsquo;s sheer size, allowing you to wander freely and take in the sights of petrified wood scattered all around.</description>

      <description>Located just south of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria State Park Campground is a perfect destination for anyone looking for a beachside retreat that also offers access to nearby amenities. With campsites situated right on the beach, some with hookups, visitors can enjoy stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and a range of outdoor activities.
One of the standout features of this campground is its proximity to Carpinteria’s charming downtown area, where visitors can find a variety of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.</description>

      <description>We end up driving down 101 frequently, and after a few hours it is nice to have a place that Cora can run around. This park is one of Cora’s favorite places. There is a park and a frisbee golf course so there is a large area to run around. It&amp;rsquo;s close to the freeway so it is easy to get to and it is close to downtown SLO if it is time to eat.</description>

      <description>There are parks that are easy to get to and that are in places where you&amp;rsquo;re likely to go so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to drop in on a trip. This is not one of them. It&amp;rsquo;s East of Bakersfield and North of Lancaster and is really a destination in itself. If you make the trip though you are rewarded by some geology you don&amp;rsquo;t often get to see.
Cora really enjoyed running around all the rocks.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of campgrounds along the southern California coast but many of them are isolated. From San Elijo you can walk to a few restaurants and directly access the walking path. The campground is on a bluff rather than right on the beach but the views are worth it.
The best sites are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 59, 60, 146, 147, 148, 150, 151, 152, 153, 155, 162, 163, 165, 168.</description>

      <title>Garrapata State Park: Sample the Big Sur Coast</title>

      <description>Just south of Carmel there are many options for viewing the Big Sur coast. My favorite one is at Garrapata State Park. Its coastal trails are easy to access, easy to hike and have great views of the coast. You can also get to the beach where you can see some interesting rock formations in the bluffs.
Nestled just south of the quaint town of Carmel lies a stretch of California&amp;rsquo;s most iconic coastline – Big Sur.</description>

      <title>A year with the Fiat 500e</title>

      <description>As I complete my first year with the 500e I wanted to share some of the data I have been collecting in case others might find it interesting.
Summary of what I learned looking at the data
The %charge indicator is very accurate. On average the MPGe indicated on the dash is 17% too high. On 1 hour of charging you can drive: 3.8 miles if charging at 120V 12.5 miles if charging from a 240V TurboCord 20 miles if charging from a Level 2 Charger Details</description>

      <title>What is MPGe?</title>

      <guid>http://danecollins.github.io/posts/mpge/</guid>
      <description>Everyone is used to seeing car mileage MPG (miles-per-gallon) ratings. Since electric cars don&amp;rsquo;t use gasoline the traditional MPG rating is not applicable, so the electric car industry created MPGe. What is MPGe mean and what is it good for?
As I look at this I see three uses for MPGe:
As marketing metric to make electric cars seem very efficient As a mechanism to compare efficiency between electric vehicles As a way to compare cost of operating electric versus gas cars Unfortunately, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that while the industry computed MPGe can be used for #1 and #2 it is quite misleading if used for #3!</description>

      <description>After the disappointment on Melville Street I was a little concerned. Of the last 4 walls we’ve visited, 3 were extinct and 1 was so covered up by new construction you can barely see it. The wall on Grandville was interesting because it was painted in only 12 hours as a continuation of the mural at the aquarium. In trying to find the wall on Google Maps it was very difficult to get an angle where I could see the wall so we we’re unsure where it should be, even though we had an address.</description>

      <description>After our success on the Grandville bridge we needed to figure out how to get to White Rock, a suburb of Vancouver. We thought of renting a car and driving down but renting a car is not always easy. We got lucky that Hertz was out of cars and the counter person suggested we take the SkyTrain and a bus to get there. She had a friend in White Rock and knew exactly how to get there on public transportation.</description>

      <description>Another ferry ride, which actually turned out to be more of a bus ride than a ferry ride, from Victoria to Vancouver and we were ready to head to another wall. From the Google street view images I could tell that Orcas was not intact because some housing had been built against it which covered some of it. When we got there we saw that the bottom of the mural was completely gone and only the top part, missing all of the whales, was left.</description>

      <description>After a ferry ride from Seattle to Victoria we decided to head over to the other end of downtown Victoria to see A-5 Pod. This was a pod that lived, and maybe still does, off Vancouver Island and this wall was painted with the individual features of the whales in that pod. The deterioration of the wall is quite apparent in the picture the building is undergoing renovation so it’s a good thing we saw this now as it may not be around for much longer.</description>

      <description>As the sun started to set on Pike Place Market, I thought the setting sun would be a good backdrop to seeing Leap of Faith, Wyland’s first mural using warm colors. As a bonus we could also see Orcas off the San Juan Islands on the opposite side of the same building which depicts the J-1 pod Wyland visited with during his stay in Seattle.
The hotel was easy to find but unfortunately there were no murals.</description>

      <description>On our trip to Seattle we flew into SeaTac which made it convenient to head straight to Tacoma to see Washington Orcas which turned out to be very easy to find. Given the wet weather here I was unsure how well it would hold up and while it is a little faded it is holding up well. This wall depicts a pod of whales that resides near Tacoma.
Across the parking lot is a small insurance office with the best view in Tacoma!</description>

      <description>After the disappointment in Santa Monica and Chicago we were looking forward to finding wall that was intact. On a trip to LA for a wedding, we got there a few hours early which gave us an opportunity to run up to Hollywood. Life Size Blue Whales turned out to be much easier to find being on the wall of one of the building on the outside of the Paramount complex.</description>

      <description>Our company Christmas party was in Santa Monica and since we needed to spend the night it gave us a great opportunity to visit “Santa Monica’s Marine Life” on the Pier. With a clear and crisp morning we took a nice walk to the pier and walked the entire pier looking for the mural but to no avail. We asked at the police station on the pier but they could not help us.</description>

      <description>We went to spend the weekend in Chicago. It was our first time there and we had a great time. When it came time to look for the The Windy Whales we were not sure what we would find. Wikipedia lists the wall as extinct. We had no trouble finding the Inter-Continental hotel but when we got there we found that they had built an apartment building covering most of it.</description>

      <description>One of the first things we noticed walking by Whales off the Coast of Maine was the sea turtle which we saw for the first time. This wall is in a great spot as you can walk right along it for the full length of the pier.
The sun has taken it’s toll on this wall with the images showing significant fading but it’s definitely worth seeing.
Like the wall in New Bedford this wall let’s you see several different types of whales as well as dolphins all on one wall.</description>

      <description>Looking at the online pictures of Isle of Shoals Humpbacks it looks wonderful and we were really looking forward to seeing it. Upon getting there though it was sad to see the shape the wall is in.
It’s clear this was a great wall when it was created but it has not aged well with a lot of the paint missing. An additional disappointment was seeing graffiti on the wall.</description>

      <description>I always wonder how Wyland selected the locations for his walls. Some just seem too secluded for how great they are but the Great Whales of New Bedford is not one of those. As you drive in to New Bedford you just can’t miss the walls of the Marine Terminal with whales covering all sides of the building. Given the significance of whales to New Bedford this wall seems so at home here and being one of the newer walls is in such great shape.</description>

      <description>Driving into New London, CT while staring at the iPhone for directions and looking for street signs we managed to drive right past The Great Sperm Whales without seeing it which is pretty hard as it’s right on the main street. The wall is in great shape and is one of the most approachable walls we’ve seen. The wall is big and it was pretty hard to get all of it in a picture so here is part of it.</description>

      <description>When we first started looking at the location of all the walls and I saw Salt Lake City I figured it would be a long time before we got to that one. Goes to show how life can be unpredictable.
Just 5 months after we started this adventure we find ourselves moving to Boulder and driving right through Salt Lake City on our way there. With just a little planning it was easy to get there during the day when we could see World of Ocean Life.</description>

      <description>We found ourselves quite lucky when we got to the Long Beach Convention Center to find that there was no conference. The place was deserted and this make it quite each for us to go around the entire conference center and see the entire wall. If you go to the hotel next to the convention center you can go up to the 17th floor and from the hallway windows you can get a great overall view of the painting but unfortunately it’s still not high enough to be able to see the painting on the roof.</description>

      <description>We had actually seen Gray Whale Migration once before. One of the few walls we were not seeing for the first time but it’s just as impressive the second time around.
Seeing a beautiful wall like this where the owners let so much vegetation cover it up makes me wonder why they wanted it. It would be so easy to keep it clear. This wall contains his first blue whale on a whaling wall.</description>

      <description>The benefit of heading to Laguna Beach a second time is that we knew exactly where to go. I was worried that it would be hard to get a picture of both us and Pacific Realm since it is on the ceiling but that turned out not to be too hard.
Like all of the walls there is just no way to really do justice to them in pictures as they cover so much area.</description>

      <description>After chasing down pictures of yachts we knew the next wall would be easier to find and take a picture of since it would not be moving. We just saw it a little earlier than expected.
We started Father’s day with a Segway tour of San Diego which was a ton of fun. While on the tour it seemed some of the buildings were familiar. I had not been to that part of town before but I did a lot of looking around in Google street view looking for the wall and while we waited at a stop light I turned to see Life Size Blue Whales right there.</description>

      <description>After the uncertainty in looking for #2 we felt much more certain about finding Orcas off Point Loma as we knew it was at Belmont Park and at an indoor pool. The big questions were whether we would have to pay to get into the park and whether there was any way to get inside the pool.
It turns out, unlike Disneyland or Sea World which requires everyone to pay to get in, Belmont Park has no entrance fee.</description>

      <title>Del Mar Fairgrounds #94</title>

      <description>Ride the Tide at the Del Mar fairgrounds is visible from the 5 freeway so it’s not hard to find. Unfortunately, the time we could visit it turned out to be when the fair was going on which made it considerable harder to get to it. We did manage to find a drop-off spot at the fairgrounds and were able to get a picture from a distance but could not get as close as we would have liked.</description>

      <description>When I first started researching Race to Save the Ocean I actually put it into the extinct category because I figured a privately owned racing yacht is not something you could get access to, if it even still existed. I was wrong. While talking to my Dad I learned that not only did the yacht still exist, but that it was used as a charter boat sailing out of San Diego.</description>

      <description>In trying to find walls, it’s sometimes hard to know what reference material to use. All the sources said that Young Gray Whale was no longer at the Ocean Institute but the Wyland site said it was at R. H. Dana Elementary in Dana Point while Wikipedia said it was at Concordia Elementary in San Clemente.
Since Dana Point is on the way to San Clemente (from Laguna Beach) we decided to head there first.</description>

      <description>While traveling to San Diego we wanted to drive through Laguna Beach, as we knew there were several walls we could see there. We hoped these walls would be easy to find, given some of our experiences. Fortunately, they were.
We first found Laguna Coast which is on the side wall of a very cool store that’s definitely worth stopping in. If you’ve never tried to lift a meteorite this is your chance.</description>

      <description>While on my first trip to Beijing I managed to plan a free afternoon and remembered Wyland painted a wall for the Olympics. Searching the Internet in China can be a little bit of a challenge and getting reliable information on the wall was difficult. After some work I found that it was in Chaoyang Park. The park is large and I was not sure I could find it but it was worth a try.</description>

      <description>We have enjoyed Wyland&amp;rsquo;s work for many years and had seen some of his walls while traveling. One day while at Pier 39 in San Francisco we were looking at one of these walls and thinking how fun it would be to get our picture in front of some of them.
With this simple first picture started what I&amp;rsquo;m sure will be a long term journey to search for these walls.</description>
