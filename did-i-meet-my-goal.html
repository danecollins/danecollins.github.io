      <p>Like many people that have fitness trackers, I set a daily goal. It's great to look at the end of the day and see if I have met my goal but when I want to look back at a month, or a year, to see how well I'm doing it is pretty hard to do.</p>
<p>I can go to the fitbit.com site and look at a month of data and see</p>
<p><img alt="Fitbit Graph" src="images/goals_fig1.png"></p>
<p>but it is hard to see which days I did not meet my goal from this. If I want to look at a whole year, all I can do is look at monthly totals which is not very useful.</p>
<p>I knew I needed a pretty compact format if I wanted to see a whole year at a time. Something like a scatter plot.  Then I remembered a chart I had see at a Tufte course and knew what I wanted.  By converting my days from steps to either "goal met" or "goal not met" I could simplify the presentation.  Using a skinny bar chart I arrived at this.</p>
<p><img alt="Compact Daily Chart" src="images/goals_fig2.png"></p>
<p>This allows me to see a full year with the strokes going up being days that I met my goal and strokes going down being the days that I missed my goal. This make it clear that I'm missing my goal way too often but also that the days I miss my goal are not as isolated as I hoped with some long streaks.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this representation is that I have one more dimension to play with: color. I speculated that my out-of-town travel was a reason I was missing my goal. By using red as the color when I'm on work travel, blue for vacation travel and green for when I'm home I could turn the image into this.</p>
<p><img alt="Colored Compact Chart" src="images/goals_fig3.png"></p>
<p>Here I can see that when I'm on vacation I still do pretty well but there are a lot of those goal misses on work travel days.</p>
<p>Another perk of this format is that it is easy to stack these up to show multiple year at once. Here is 2 full years of data.</p>
<p><img alt="Two Year Chart" src="images/goals_fig4.png"></p>
<p>I've found this presentation useful. I can now imagine using color to represent which days I went cycling or days when it rained. Lots of options.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have found a good way to visually represent step data.</p>
