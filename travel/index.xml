      <description>Located just south of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria State Park Campground is a perfect destination for anyone looking for a beachside retreat that also offers access to nearby amenities. With campsites situated right on the beach, some with hookups, visitors can enjoy stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and a range of outdoor activities.
One of the standout features of this campground is its proximity to Carpinteria’s charming downtown area, where visitors can find a variety of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.</description>

      <description>We end up driving down 101 frequently, and after a few hours it is nice to have a place that Cora can run around. This park is one of Cora’s favorite places. There is a park and a frisbee golf course so there is a large area to run around. It&amp;rsquo;s close to the freeway so it is easy to get to and it is close to downtown SLO if it is time to eat.</description>
