  * 	Pat had his car broken into in the carport last night. It was locked and there was nothing of value in there, but they took his iPod of all things and some keys to our storage units which weren’t marked so no way they would know what to do with them. I filed a police report and asked for extra patrol, for whatever that’s worth.
