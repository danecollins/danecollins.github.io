<p>Looking at the online pictures of <em>Isle of Shoals Humpbacks</em> it looks wonderful and we were really looking forward to seeing it. Upon getting there though it was sad to see the shape the wall is in.</p>
<p>It’s clear this was a great wall when it was created but it has not aged well with a lot of the paint missing. An additional disappointment was seeing graffiti on the wall. This is the first time we’ve run into one of Wyland’s wall being defaced.</p>
<p>As often happens when we see these we wonder “Why this wall?”. This wall faces a parking lot that is not really visible from the main streets. If you did not know it was there it is unlikely you would run into it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Cabot House- 64 Vaughn Mall
Portsmouth, New Hampshire
220 Feet Long x 40 Feet High
Dedicated June 14th, 1993

<p>*By the time Wyland reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the second city scheduled on the East Coast Tour, the artist and his crew knew they were in for a long, grueling 17 weeks. But the community’s exuberance and genuine interests in the Whaling Wall project picked up their spirits, resulting in a beautiful mural for the people of this city.</p>
<p>“This mural was critical to the tour because it was the first test of how fast we could finish a wall in one city and move on to the next city and get started.” Wyland recalls, “it was a real challenge, but we met it and were on our way. The reaction of the people of Portsmouth really helped to rejuvenate us.”</p>
<p>Portsmouth Mayor Eileen Foley presented Wyland with the key to the city, and the Shoals Marine Laboratory at the University of New Hampshire started a fundraising scholarship program in the artist’s name, “I was especially proud of the fundraiser,” Wyland says. “The money will be used to start a lectureship about marine mammals in the Gulf of Maine.”</p>
<p>The mural, painted on two walls of the Cabot House furniture store facing the Vaughn Mall parking lot, depicts three humpback whales that frequent the local waters, as well as a family of dolphins and school of tuna. “I must have talked to everyone in this town, especially the children,” Wyland claims. If I didn’t, I’m hoping the Whaling Wall will.”*</p>
