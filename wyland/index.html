    <div class="content">After the disappointment on Melville Street I was a little concerned. Of the last 4 walls we’ve visited, 3 were extinct and 1 was so covered up by new construction you can barely see it. The wall on Grandville was interesting because it was painted in only 12 hours as a continuation of the mural at the aquarium. In trying to find the wall on Google Maps it was very difficult to get an angle where I could see the wall so we we’re unsure where it should be, even though we had an address.</div>

    <div class="content">After our success on the Grandville bridge we needed to figure out how to get to White Rock, a suburb of Vancouver. We thought of renting a car and driving down but renting a car is not always easy. We got lucky that Hertz was out of cars and the counter person suggested we take the SkyTrain and a bus to get there. She had a friend in White Rock and knew exactly how to get there on public transportation.</div>

    <div class="content">Another ferry ride, which actually turned out to be more of a bus ride than a ferry ride, from Victoria to Vancouver and we were ready to head to another wall. From the Google street view images I could tell that Orcas was not intact because some housing had been built against it which covered some of it. When we got there we saw that the bottom of the mural was completely gone and only the top part, missing all of the whales, was left.</div>

    <div class="content">After a ferry ride from Seattle to Victoria we decided to head over to the other end of downtown Victoria to see A-5 Pod. This was a pod that lived, and maybe still does, off Vancouver Island and this wall was painted with the individual features of the whales in that pod. The deterioration of the wall is quite apparent in the picture the building is undergoing renovation so it’s a good thing we saw this now as it may not be around for much longer.</div>

    <div class="content">As the sun started to set on Pike Place Market, I thought the setting sun would be a good backdrop to seeing Leap of Faith, Wyland’s first mural using warm colors. As a bonus we could also see Orcas off the San Juan Islands on the opposite side of the same building which depicts the J-1 pod Wyland visited with during his stay in Seattle.
The hotel was easy to find but unfortunately there were no murals.</div>

    <div class="content">On our trip to Seattle we flew into SeaTac which made it convenient to head straight to Tacoma to see Washington Orcas which turned out to be very easy to find. Given the wet weather here I was unsure how well it would hold up and while it is a little faded it is holding up well. This wall depicts a pod of whales that resides near Tacoma.
Across the parking lot is a small insurance office with the best view in Tacoma!</div>

    <div class="content">After the disappointment in Santa Monica and Chicago we were looking forward to finding wall that was intact. On a trip to LA for a wedding, we got there a few hours early which gave us an opportunity to run up to Hollywood. Life Size Blue Whales turned out to be much easier to find being on the wall of one of the building on the outside of the Paramount complex.</div>

    <div class="content">Our company Christmas party was in Santa Monica and since we needed to spend the night it gave us a great opportunity to visit “Santa Monica’s Marine Life” on the Pier. With a clear and crisp morning we took a nice walk to the pier and walked the entire pier looking for the mural but to no avail. We asked at the police station on the pier but they could not help us.</div>

    <div class="content">We went to spend the weekend in Chicago. It was our first time there and we had a great time. When it came time to look for the The Windy Whales we were not sure what we would find. Wikipedia lists the wall as extinct. We had no trouble finding the Inter-Continental hotel but when we got there we found that they had built an apartment building covering most of it.</div>

    <div class="content">One of the first things we noticed walking by Whales off the Coast of Maine was the sea turtle which we saw for the first time. This wall is in a great spot as you can walk right along it for the full length of the pier.
The sun has taken it’s toll on this wall with the images showing significant fading but it’s definitely worth seeing.
Like the wall in New Bedford this wall let’s you see several different types of whales as well as dolphins all on one wall.</div>
