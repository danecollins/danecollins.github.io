      <description>Do your own data analysis on Apple Health DataWhen Apple came out with the Watch and Health Apps they were quite limited and it seemed like they were not that useful. As Apple does with many products, it continued to improve these products, and there is now an abundance of data available through the Health App. Even with these improvements, the analyses that can be performed in the apps are limited.</description>

      <description>As I complete my first year with the 500e I wanted to share some of the data I have been collecting in case others might find it interesting.
Summary of what I learned looking at the data
The %charge indicator is very accurate.Â On average the MPGe indicated on the dash is 17% too high. On 1 hour of charging you can drive: 3.8 miles if charging at 120V 12.5 miles if charging from a 240V TurboCord 20 miles if charging from a Level 2 Charger Details</description>

      <description>Everyone is used to seeing car mileage MPG (miles-per-gallon) ratings. Since electric cars don&amp;rsquo;t use gasoline the traditional MPG rating is not applicable, so the electric car industry created MPGe. What is MPGe mean and what is it good for?
As I look at this I see three uses for MPGe:
As marketing metric to make electric cars seem very efficient As a mechanism to compare efficiency between electric vehicles As a way to compare cost of operating electric versus gas cars Unfortunately, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that while the industry computed MPGe can be used for #1 and #2 it is quite misleading if used for #3!</description>
