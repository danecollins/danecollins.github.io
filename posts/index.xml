      <description>As I complete my first year with the 500e I wanted to share some of the data I have been collecting in case others might find it interesting.
Summary of what I learned looking at the data
The %charge indicator is very accurate.Â On average the MPGe indicated on the dash is 17% too high. On 1 hour of charging you can drive: 3.8 miles if charging at 120V 12.5 miles if charging from a 240V TurboCord 20 miles if charging from a Level 2 Charger Details</description>

      <description>Everyone is used to seeing car mileage MPG (miles-per-gallon) ratings. Since electric cars don&amp;rsquo;t use gasoline the traditional MPG rating is not applicable, so the electric car industry created MPGe. What is MPGe mean and what is it good for?
As I look at this I see three uses for MPGe:
As marketing metric to make electric cars seem very efficient As a mechanism to compare efficiency between electric vehicles As a way to compare cost of operating electric versus gas cars Unfortunately, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is that while the industry computed MPGe can be used for #1 and #2 it is quite misleading if used for #3!</description>
