Timeline (120 min total)

* 20 min to brown meat
* 10 min to deglaze pan
* 90 min to bake



Steps
-----

1.	COMBINE FLOUR, SALT AND PEPPER on a plate.
2.	DREDGE BEEF in mixture, shaking off excess
3.	BROWN BEEF on all sides in hot olive oil and transfer to large stoneware casserole
4.	POUR OFF FAT, ADD STOCK AND THEN VINEGAR to saute pan. Bring to a boil, scraping up any bits from the bottom.
5.	ADD TO CASSEROLE
6.	COVER AND PLACE IN PREHEATED 375º OVEN for 1 ½ hours, until tender




Notes
-----

* Dredge right before you cook so flour does not draw moisture out of meat.
* Liquid should cover only about 3/4 of meat in casserole dish, might need to use less than all the liquid.
* Don’t overfill saute pan when browning meat.
* Can store in refrigerator up to 3 days.  Before serving, allow to come to room temperature for 1 hour and reheat in a preheated 375º oven until hot, about 35 to 45 minutes.
