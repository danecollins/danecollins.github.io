**In Campbell, 350 is too high and will burn**

2.	DREDGE BEEF in mixture, shaking off excess
3.	BROWN BEEF on all sides in hot olive oil and transfer to large stoneware casserole
4.	POUR OFF FAT, ADD STOCK AND THEN VINEGAR to saute pan. Bring to a boil, scraping up any bits from the bottom.
5.	Add to caserole
6.	Bake at 325º for 1 ½ hours, until tender



Notes
-----

_Try to use 2 tbs of roux instead of flour and water_

* Dredge right before you cook so flour does not draw moisture out of meat.
* Liquid should cover only about 3/4 of meat in casserole dish, might need to use less than all the liquid.
* Don’t overfill saute pan when browning meat.
* Can store in refrigerator up to 3 days.  Before serving, allow to come to room temperature for 1 hour and reheat in a preheated 375º oven until hot, about 35 to 45 minutes.
