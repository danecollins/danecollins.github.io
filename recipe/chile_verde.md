7. Pressure cook 30 minutes, let rest 10 minutes or cook for 6 hours in crock pot
8. Thicken to taste if needed


## Notes

- Can add some lime juice if available
- Spicyness is adjusted inclusion of seeds and stems from jalapenos. I remove seeds but leave stems.
- Browining of vegetables and pork (#4 and #5) is optional
- Using large tomatillos (> ~1.5") makes the sauce sweet.  Small is better.
- Tomatillos needs to be rinsed well in warm water to remove stickness from husks.
- The amount of tomatillos is a big factor in thickness of sauce (more=thinner)
- Pork butt is more tender but requires more trimming. Almost any cut will work with variation in tenderness of pork.
